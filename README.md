This is a simple implementation of a Markov chain whith a 2-word prefix.

__./mchain__: given a text file will print a associative array where each line has them format *w1 w2=w3* (where w1 and w2 are the prefix and w3 the suffix with one or more space separated words.) to the standard output so you can redirect it to wherever you want.

Eg.:
> ./mchain my_text_file > chain.txt

__./mgen__: will take a "chain" generated by *mchain* and start generating phrases by selecting an initial prefix at random.

Eg.:
> ./mgen chain.txt

By default *mgen* will generate output until it finds the *--END--* marker or a prefix which returns a blank string. You can also set the variable *limit* so it will generate at most *limit* words plus the initial 2-word prefix.

Eg.:
> ./mgen -v limit=10 chain.txt #*will print at most 10 words plus prefix*

You use the file *music.txt* to see how it works:
> ./mchain music.txt > chain.txt  
> ./mgen chain.txt  

or

> ./mchain music.txt | ./mchain
